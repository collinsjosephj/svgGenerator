#   ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg) svgGenerator: a CLI application

## Overview

This is an example of a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file. As a freelance web developer, one will often need simple logos created for projects, and hiring out a graphic designer can be both costly and time-consuming. This CLI application allows the user to quickly generate a basic logo for your needs, helping you save precious time and money. Link to demonstration can be found within the README below.
